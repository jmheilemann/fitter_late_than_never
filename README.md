# Fitter Late Than Never

Welcome to Fitter Later than Never, an exercise gamification app to help you get back in shape after sitting in quarantine for over a year!

After you log in, you’ll be on the main page of the website where Shia LaBeouf will remind you to Just Do It. The log out button is also located on this page. 

You can navigate to the profile page to see your current level, amount of XP, and some more motivational quotes. You got this!

You can submit a log of your exercise to earn XP on the Submit Log tab. These will be available for you to view, post to Facebook, and delete on the View Logs tab. You can also view comments left on your logs, or comment on other logs here. Motivate your fellow exercisers to keep it up! 

The Achievements tab allows you to get inspiration for exercises to do, as well as helpful videos on how to do them safely. Once you’ve completed an achievement up to the specified minute or repetition mark, click the “Achievement Done!” button to gain a boost of XP (and dopamine).

On the Leaderboard page, you can see how you’re doing compared to other users on the site. 
A little friendly competition never hurt anybody! Click on other users' names to see their logs for motivation, insight, or to fuel your competitive hunger. Try to get to the top by completing more intense, longer exercises (but be safe while you do)!
